# Nativeci sql demo
This demo shows to develop a simple twitter-like application which uses database (mysql) for persisting users and posts data.

In order to run this project, fork it and create a new project in nativeci, using go-database folder.

Set environment variable named JWT_SECRET to a random secret for security.

Next create a database, connect to it using attach button, copy the contents of tables.sql and run it in the database.

After that connect the database to the application and you are good to go :)
